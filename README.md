React Frontend for "Chefs-Pantry" Capstone Project

Spoonacular Api

This is an app to you catalog and organize your kitchen as far as potential ingredients to cook with.

The inspiration for this app came about during the pandemic of 2019. Like the rest of the world, my roomate and I were unsure of the future. This was a time when there wasn't much information out on the pandemic and it was difficult to determine how to go proceed to best prepare for the future. Instinctively my roomate and I began hoarding dried and preserved goods. We took advantage of every available chance to stock up on food. At the end of the year we had accumulated quite the trove of goods. This trove had little no organization and often included items that didn't work well with eachother. This made using these these items a hassle and often detered my roomate and I from pulling from the trove. We still have some of this collection today.

This app allows you to signup and login. After logging in the user can use a search bar that is connected to an api of ingredients. The user can search  through this catalog of ingredients, select an amount, and add this to their "Pantry". The user can view their pantry as well as remove items from it.
